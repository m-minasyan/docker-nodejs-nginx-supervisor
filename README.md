# Docker Node.js & Nginx with Supervisor

## Overview
This Docker setup is designed to run a Node.js application behind an Nginx reverse proxy, managed by Supervisor. It demonstrates best practices and is optimized for performance and reliability.

## Features
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Nginx**: High-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy.
- **Supervisor**: A client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.
- **Alpine Linux**: A security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

## Requirements
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization.

## Setup and Configuration

### Dockerfile
The `Dockerfile` sets up the Node.js environment, installs necessary packages, and configures Nginx and Supervisor.

### Nginx Configuration (`docker/nginx.conf`)
Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the Node.js application. It includes optimized settings for performance and security.

### Supervisor Configuration
- `docker/supervisord-programs.conf`: Configures the processes for Node.js and Nginx.
- `docker/supervisord.conf`: Main configuration file for Supervisor.

## How to Use

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   docker build -t my-nodejs-app .
2. **Run the Container**:
   docker run -d -p 80:80 my-nodejs-app

This command runs the container in detached mode, binding the host's port 80 to the container's port 80.

3. **Access the Application**:
- The Node.js application will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

4. **Logs and Monitoring**:
- Use Docker commands to monitor the logs and status of your container.

## Customization
You can customize the Nginx and Supervisor configurations according to your needs. Make sure to rebuild the Docker image after making changes.
